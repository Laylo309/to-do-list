# Awesome Books - A complete website with navigation

> This repository is about an example of how to build your own JavaScript application using Local Storage to save data in your browser.

For this particular repository, we've fixed our web app to create three sections in order to separate the list of books, the form to add a new book, and the contact us section. Also, we used the luxon library to add the datetime to our project.
